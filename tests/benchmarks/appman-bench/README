The appman-bench is a tool using a known, minimal System UI
environment to benchmark the application manager itself and
apps started by it.

The benchmark tests the following:
* cpu load
* gpu load
* memory consumption
* fps

The bench provides a collection of small qml test files.
These qml test files are loaded in a System UI, as well
as in every app which is started.
The System UI waits for all apps to be started and starts
measuring while keeping them running for some time.

The bench provides a way to change what runtime is used
for testing and enables us to see differences between the
appman-launcher-qml and qmlscene binaries.
New tests can be added by writing a qml file and putting it into
the test folder.
