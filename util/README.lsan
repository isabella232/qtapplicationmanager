You need these suppressions when running with Wayland, as QtWaylandCompositor
does not delete anything on shutdown:

export LSAN_OPTIONS="suppressions=<path/to/appman>/util/lsan.suppressions"


Please note: the qml/resources auto-test will report leaks, but these
are deliberate: we cannot unload resource files once they are loaded in
single-process mode.
